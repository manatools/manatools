Configure polkit
----------------

Please copy extras/org.mageia.policykit.pkexec.adminpanel.policy to /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.mageia.policykit.pkexec.adminpanel.policy
to make apanel be usable through policykit (mcc is currently using pam, a bit more complicated compared to polkit).

After that you have to make a symbolic link to apanel.pl into /usr/bin/  (i.e. /usr/bin/apanel.pl) and make your local apanel.pl script executable (chmod +x apanel.pl).

This settings will be automatically handled at rpm installation time in future/production.

Add AdminPanel to the include path (for developers)
---------------------------------------------------

symlink trunk/AdminPanel to /usr/lib/perl5/<currentversion>/AdminPanel
where currentversion could be for example 5.16.2

Additional notes:
1. if you have installed old org.mageia.policykit.pkexec.policy remove it from /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/
2. you can use at your own risk our script from this directory create_link.sh
