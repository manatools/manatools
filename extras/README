Please copy extras/org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.policy to /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.policy
to make apanel be usable through policykit (mcc is currently using pam, a bit more complicated compared to polkit).

After that you have to make a symbolic link to apanel.pl into /usr/bin/  (i.e. /usr/bin/apanel.pl) and make your local apanel.pl script executable (chmod +x apanel.pl).

This settings will be automatically handled at rpm installation time in future/production.

TODO:
- support to pam (wip)
- add testing/develop exceptions (avoid to insert password at develop time)
