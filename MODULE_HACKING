AdminPanel Modules

AdminPanel is basically an application launcher, so everything
executable file can be run really. To get benefit of UI abstarction
though, the "modules" should be written with the use of libYUI, yast
user interface abstraction, so that they can be run using a  Gtk, ncurses
or Qt environment in a transparent manner.
Modules based on libYUi can be written in C++, using the native language, 
python, ruby and perl, using libYUI bindings.

AdminPanel is written in perl, so it also add a native approach,
for perl modules.

How to write a perl AdminPanel module 
======================================

AdminPanel module are written using Moose wit an OO apporach.
Modules are extension of the AdminPanel::Module class.

- Code alignemnt
As a simple code convention, we add the followin line at the
beginning of the file

# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4: 

So that using vim we force to get tabs to be 4 characters
and considered as blanks, so please if you use another editor
and you want to include your code under adminpanel tree_callback
keep this convention.

- POD
Then add POD to your file, we are trying to pass "make test"
and POD is one of the important tests. 
It's not only a matter of test of course, having the manual
and a good documentation of the modules is mandatory.
Remember also that the code could/should be read and understood by 
other people, so try to keep POD aligned.

- Internal declaration
Internal functions or methods are "_" predfixed, e.g.
sub _foo {
}

- Module template
Try to keep distinct the GUI layout and the module back-end. Since
the module is a configuration tool for the most, one thing is the
graphic user interface and another is a lower level interface. Such
an approach allows to use shared things also into other projects
that don't want to use YUI bindings for instance.

Said that you have to:   
1. Define the package name usually like:
   package AdminPanel::Module::MyModule;

2. Use Moose and yui, the first to extend Module the latter for libYUI
   bindings.

3. Extend AdminPanel::Module defining a "start" method that has to be invokated
   by AdminPanel.
   Other important things are icon and name attributes, please look at other modules
   code and to Moose documentation how to do it.
   
4. Add the module to configuration file so that apanel can load it (see below).

Some share code is into AdminPanel::Shared modules, such as Locales to manage localization
or Module back-ends for instance.

- AdminPanel configuration (how to run a module)

apanel can be run using a "name" parameter and eventually by forcing a configuration
directory path where to find configuration files.
Default name is apanel, and the name by convention is the place in witch to find
configuration files under /etc.
So apanel will look for: 
/etc/apanel/settings.conf
/etc/apanel/categories.conf
categories can also be searched under:
/etc/apanel/categories.conf.d/MyModule.conf

How to run modules is defined into categories.conf or alternatively
MyModule.conf under the related categories.conf.d.
Last method allows to write a Module that is not under the AdminPanel 
development tree, and easily install, load and run it using apanel.

Categories are icon buttons that can contain more modules, so to have
a old mcc view:
_______________
|C |          |
|A |          |
|T | Modules  |
|E |          |
|G.|          |
---------------
Layout can change in future though.

Let's see an example
<category>
    <title>Hardware</title>
    <icon>/usr/share/icons/configuration_section.png</icon>
    <module>
        <class>AdminPanel::Module::AdminMouse</class>
    </module>
    <module>
        <title>Module name</title>
        <launcher>PATH/to/lunch/module</launcher>
        <icon>absolute/paht/to/module/icon</icon>
    </module>
</category>

First module is a perl AdminPanel::Module extension (AdminMouse),
latter is an external one, as you can see could be a script
as well as an executable command.
Look at settings.conf and categories.conf for details.
