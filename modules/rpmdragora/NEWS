Version 2.0-24mdk - Tue Sep 10 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- fix program exiting when in "maximum informations" in rpmdrake-remove
- fix english typo, "informations" with an "s" doesn't english

- Update icons

Version 2.0-9mdk - Mon Aug 26 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- grpmi: don't display successful end message when installing packages
  so that we have back the old behaviour and it's better for programs
  requesting several packages installation in a row (standalone apps);
  the successful message is still here in rpmdrake, it's displayed
  by rpmdrake itself
- rpmdrake: when choosing between packages, add the ability to have
  information about each package choice (one button per package)

Version 2.0-8mdk - Mon Aug 26 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- rpmdrake-remove: don't show basesystem packages so that it
  becomes possible to select whole categories in "Mandrake
  Choices" mode (Development/Development for example)
- rpmdrake-remove: API of urpm.pm has changed (fixes "/" not an ARRAY
  reference)

Version 2.0-7mdk - Fri Aug 23 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- rpmdrake: when a choice has to be made involving locales,
  autochoose the package requiring the locales already installed
  on the machine, or the package requiring an already selected
  locale
- rpmdrake: when user does a multiple selection of packages to
  install, if some packages require a new locale to install and
  they look like i18n packages (eg they contain the same locale
  name in their name), don't select them; it should fix the
  selection of all the locales when user selects "KDE
  Workstation" or "Gnome Workstation"; of course, still possible
  to select these packages one by one
- in by_presence and by_selection modes, limit search results to
  upgradable packages and to selected packages

Version 2.0-6mdk - Thu Aug 22 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- edit-urpm-sources: toggle the ignore flag only when the button
  press was really done in an existing col/row
- rpmdrake: definitively fix the compssUsers.flat missing problem
  by having a "default" file for fallbacking on it when the DrakX
  generated one is missing
- grpmi: add an rcfile and the "noclearcache" option so that
  /var/lib/urpmi/cache/rpms/ is not cleared after trying to install
  the packages
- rpmdrake: use the width of current font to set the maximum size
  of the packages column, rather than pure hardcoding
- rpmdrake.pm: since timezone::read doesn't give a hash anymore but
  a hashref I need to reflect that in my code (pixel sux)
- grpmi: don't forget to unlink the tmpfile even when the
  signature is not correct
- grpmi: use my_gtk::exit so that mouse cursor gets fixed when
  exiting
- rpmdrake: keep up the main window when installing/removing
  packages, "it looks more professional"
- rpmdrake: fix exiting program when an hdlist seems corrupted to
  packdrake
- rpmdrake: add "search in descriptions", have an optionmenu to
  select the search type, have a progressbar and a stop button
  because it can be take a long time
- rpmdrake: have it possible to cancel a selection when user is not
  happy of the dependencies of the selection
- rpmdrake: use some hackery in my_gtk and in rpmdrake to really
  have a [+] in front of parent categories even if they are not
  really populated
- MandrakeUpdate: when user cancels the initial choose of mirror,
  explain that she can selects a manual mirror from the sources
  manager
- (fcrozat) provide .desktop files to have rpmdrake stuff in
  Nautilus when rpmdrake package is installed
- MandrakeUpdate: don't only use "update_source" as an update
  source, but all the sources marked as update by urpmi (fixes
  not taking into account the update source defined during
  install, if any)

Version 2.0-5mdk - Mon Aug  5 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- when searching in files, limit search results to listed
  packages or the program might crash
- when searching in files, do it case sensitive
- in MandrakeUpdate mode, display a nice explanation message when
  the list of updates is void, and also put "(none)" in the list
  instead of seeing nothing and wondering if something is broken
  or not
- don't quit when validation was not ok (e.g. when user doesn't
  like the "these packages need to be removed for others to be
  upgraded", don't quit)
- handle case when use entered ftp location with a leading ftp://
- edit-urpm-sources: don't strictly require that all the fields be
  filled since urpmi can make guesses or build the hdlist itself;
  in removable and local modes, give the probe_with_hdlist option
  when the hdlist field is void

Version 2.0-4mdk - Mon Aug  5 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- grpmi: provide information about the number of current download and
  number of overall downloads, same with installation of packages
- have compssUsers.flat a ghost file, so that rpm doesn't remove it
  when upgrading from rpmdrake-1.5 series
- substitute popuping Menu to get more sort methods by OptionMenu in
  one of the Radio, it should be easier for users to find them here
- don't exit at the end of the action, but restart
- add "update..." button in edit-urpm-sources to update the desired
  media
- when a search didn't get any results, tell it
- add searching in files facility (decision is made upon the presence
  of a / in the search field)
- try harder to really honour ignored media when trying to guess
  in which medium is a package
- don't die when a header could not be extracted

Version 2.0-3mdk - Fri Aug  2 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- fix mouse cursor problem by calling my_gtk::exit instead of perl's
- fix grpmi exiting on illegal division by zero when curl reports a
  download of zero size
- allow user to cancel on medium changes

Version 2.0-2mdk - Fri Aug  2 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- workaround packdrake segfault when hdlist is not available for
  a source (by file testing if the hdlist is readable)

Version 2.0 - Thu Aug  1 2002, Guillaume Cottenceau

- c'mon rpmdrake, strike back in Perl!
