AdminPanel

AdminPanel is a collection of configuration tools that allows
users to configure most of their system components in a very simple, 
intuitive and attractive interface. It consists of several modules 
that can be also run as autonomous applications.

It is started as a porting of MCC (Mageia/Mandriva Control Center)
to libYui (Suse widget abstraction library), but its aim is to give 
an easy and common interface to developer to add new modules based
on libYui. Every modules as well as AdminPanel itself can be run
using QT, Gtk or ncurses interface.
